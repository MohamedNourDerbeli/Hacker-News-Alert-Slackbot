## ðŸ¤” What is it?

This is a basic Slack Bot that:
1. Fetches top Hacker News stories
2. Filters them based on keywords
3. Sends a slack message to a list of users, notifying them of any matches.

Set-up and deployment takes only 5 minutes! With _Scheduled Deployments_, you can execute the script as often as you'd like.

Add these to your Repl in the _Secrets_ pane (âŒ˜ + K and type "secrets").

### ðŸŽ½ Deploying Your App

Once you have your application configured and tokens set, you can hit `Run` (âŒ˜ + Enter) in Replit to execute `app.py`. 

To have your bot execute on a schedule, head over to "Deployments" (âŒ˜ + K, "deployments") to create a "Scheduled" deployment. This deployment uses `cron` syntax to execute the job on a regular cadence.
